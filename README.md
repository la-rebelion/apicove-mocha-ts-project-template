# My Mocha TypeScript Project

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use Mocha to test TypeScript code generated by the APICove Tools. The project contains a simple TypeScript file with a function that adds two numbers together, and a test file that tests the function using Mocha.

Use it to copy and paste the code generated by the [APICove Tools](https://tools.apicove.com/) into your project, simple and easy to use, Rebels! ✊🏽

## Files

### `src/index.ts`

This file is the entry point of the application. It contains the main code that you want to test.

### `test/index.test.ts`

This file contains the test cases for the code in `src/index.ts`. It uses the Mocha testing framework to define and run the tests.

### `tsconfig.json`

This file is the configuration file for TypeScript. It specifies the compiler options and the files to include in the compilation.

### `package.json`

This file is the configuration file for `yarn`/`npm`. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.

## Getting Started

**NOTE: Use `yarn` preferably**, but you can use `npm` as well. 
I had issues with `npm` and `npx` when running the tests. @fixme ⚠️

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or **`yarn install`**.
3. Run the tests by running `npm test` or **`yarn test`**.

## Codespaces

This project is configured to work with GitHub Codespaces. You can open this project in a Codespace by clicking on the "Code" button in the GitHub repository and selecting "Open with Codespaces". This will create a new Codespace with the project pre-configured and ready to use. 

You can then run the tests by opening a terminal and running `yarn test`. 

Enjoy it, rebel! ✊🏽
