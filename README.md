# My Mocha TypeScript Project

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use Mocha to test TypeScript code generated by the APICove Tools. The project contains a simple TypeScript file with a function that adds two numbers together, and a test file that tests the function using Mocha.

Use it to copy and paste the code generated by the APICove Tools into your project, simple and easy to use, Rebels! ✊🏽
